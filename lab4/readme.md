# ELE719 Lab 4 

The problem of navigating the 3WD robot to a goal position while avoiding collision with obstacles is considered in this experiment. 

By the end of this experiment, you'll be able to convert the raw readings of the IR sensors into distance measurements and implement a control strategy for the 3WD robot to do obstacle avoidance while nvagiating to a goal position.
