# ELE719 Fundamentals of Robotics Lab 3 Forward Kinematics and Kinematics Control

The purpose of this lab is to solve the motion control problem for the 3WD robot using Kinematic Control. By the end of this experiment, the student will be able to obtain the forward kinematics equation for this robot and implement a motion controller for the 3WD robot using the method of Kinematic Control.
