ELE719 Fundamentals of Robotics

This course provides a comprehensive treatment on the fundamentals of robotic manipulators and mobile robots. Topics include: homogeneous transformations, the Denavit-Hartenberg representation of linkages, solution of the forward kinematics problem. Closed-form and numerical solutions of the inverse kinematics problem. Differential kinematics and motion, Jacobian matrix,
singularities. Kinematic and dynamic model of mobile robots. Path planning, trajectory planning and motion control for mobile robots.
